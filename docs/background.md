# Package Brackground

Just an example of how [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) can be used through [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math/#mathjax-mkdocsyml) theme.

## Hard to understand maths

This package is based on a really heavy math theory that only 4 individuals in the whole world understand something.

### The core theory

Predictions are based on this really hard equation:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = m\,x + b.
\end{equation}

For this pretty hard problem, in our context, frequently $m \gt 0$ and $b \ne 0$.

## Recomendations

If you struggled to understand the concepts presented here, please read Rudin's book on Real Analysis.
